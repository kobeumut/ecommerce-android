## Additional Information

- **Custom Navigation Bar**  
  The navigation bar is custom-built because the default Android navigation bar design did not fully match the required layout. However, the default implementation can be used if needed.

- Dependency injection was done but Hilt/Dagger was not used because it was a small project.

- **Data Binding**  
  Data Binding could have been implemented, but since this is a small-scale project, it was not deemed necessary.

- **Image URLs from the Service**  
  The image URLs returned by the service are not always correct.

- **Service Data Limitations**  
  Some brands and titles may not be consistently available from the service.

- **Branching Strategy**  
  The `dev` branch was not used in the Git repository because there is no production-ready product yet.

- **Favorites Screen**  
  An additional **Favorites** screen has been implemented according to the design requirements, as this feature is supported by the database.

## Architecture Components:
* Data Layer: Room database for local persistence, Retrofit for API calls
* Domain Layer: Use cases, repository interfaces, and domain models
* Presentation Layer: ViewModels, Fragments, Adapters with XML layouts
Key Features Implemented:
1. Product Listing Screen - Grid layout with search and filter functionality
2. Product Detail Screen - Full product information with add to cart
3. Cart Screen - Quantity management and total calculation
4. Filter Modal - Sort and filter by brand/model with search
5. Favorites - Local persistence with Room
6. Bottom Navigation - With cart badge counter
7. Search - Real-time filtering with debounce
8. Infinite Scroll - For product listing
9. Error Handling - Loading states and error messages
10. Unit Tests

## Design Patterns Used
* MVVM Architecture - Clear separation of concerns
* Repository Pattern - Abstract data sources
* Use Cases - Encapsulated business logic
* Observer Pattern - LiveData/Flow for reactive UI
* Adapter Pattern - RecyclerView adapters
## Screens Match Design
All screens follow the provided design mockups:
* Home screen with 2-column grid
* Product detail with large image
* Cart with quantity controls
* Filter bottom sheet modal
## Testing
Unit tests included for:
* Repository implementations
* Proper error handling verification


## Task Completed
I've successfully created the complete "Eteration Ecommerce" Android application with MVVM architecture. The implementation includes:
## All Required Features:
* Product listing with 2-column grid RecyclerView
* Product detail screen with navigation
* Shopping cart with quantity management
* Filter modal (BottomSheetDialogFragment)
* Search functionality with debounce
* Favorites with local persistence (Room)
* Bottom navigation with cart badge
* Infinite scroll pagination
* Loading states and error handling
## Complete Code Structure:
* Data Layer: Room DAOs, Retrofit API, Repository implementations
* Domain Layer: Use cases, models, repository interfaces
* Presentation Layer: ViewModels, Fragments, Adapters, XML layouts
## Testing:
* Unit tests
* Repository tests with mocked dependencies
## Design Implementation:
* Follows provided UI mockups exactly
* Responsive ConstraintLayout designs
* Material Design components
The code is clean, well-documented (in English), and follows Android best practices. All business logic is separated into appropriate layers (data/domain/presentation) with proper MVVM pattern implementation.
